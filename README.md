# A synonymous gain-of-function mutation mimics the p53 unfolded protein response
ShapeMapper reactivity profiles of the cancer-derived p53 synonymous mutations at codon 203 (CASM203 of p53 mRNA).
Synonymous mutations (SMs) change the gene sequence without altering the encoding protein sequence and are usually overlooked due to their perceived lack of influence on protein function. However, emerging reports suggest that SMs play a significant role in disease development and progression. Here, we report that the cancer-derived p53 SM at codon 203 (CASM203) mimics the p53 unfolded protein response (UPR) by inducing the expression of the p53 isoform p47 and the consequent G2-arrest via upregulation of 14-3-3-Ïƒ.  In-cell high-throughput RNA structural mapping showed that CASM203 displayed a p53 mRNA secondary structure similar to that imposed by the Protein Kinase RNA-Like ER Kinase (PERK) during the UPR. In contrast to p53-WT, activation of PERK did not alter the structure of the p53 CASM203 mRNA, nor did it further induce p47 expression. Overall, the single gain-of-function SM mimics the p53 UPR by generating RNA secondary structures akin to the PERK-mediated p53 mRNA structural switch that induces p47 isoform translation. This underscores the importance of SMs in cancer biology and their potential to further refine genetic diagnostics.
